        <h4>Example Use Case:</h4>
        <p>A couple today feels they cannot afford a child. They freeze sperm & eggs with 10Gen and invest ₹5 lakh.</p>
        <p>After 70 years, this grows into ₹5 crore.</p>
        <p>10Gen uses the eggs/sperm, IVF, and surrogacy to give birth to a child.</p>
        <p>A funded trust of ₹5 crore supports the child's entire life in their parents' name.</p>
